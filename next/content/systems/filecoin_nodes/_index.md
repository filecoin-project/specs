This section is providing all the details needed in order to implement any of the different Filecoin Nodes. Although node types in the Filecoin blockchain are less strictly defined than in other blockchains, there are still a few different types of nodes each with its own features and characteristics.

In this section we also discuss issues related to storage of system files in Filecoin nodes. Note that by storage in this section we do not refer to the storage that a node is commiting for mining in the network, but rather the local storage that it needs to have available for keys and IPLD data among other things.

The network interface and how nodes connect with each other and interact using libp2p, as well as how to set the node's clock is also discussed here.
