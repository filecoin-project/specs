{{/* <label message_pool> */}}
The Message Pool is a subsystem in the Filecoin blockchain system. The message pool acts as the interface between Filecoin nodes and a peer-to-peer network used for off-chain message transmission. It is used by nodes to maintain a set of messages to transmit to the Filecoin VM (for "on-chain" execution).

Clients that use a message pool include:

- storage market provider and client nodes - for transmission of deals on chain
- storage miner nodes - for transmission of PoSts, sector commitments, deals, and other operations tracked on chain
- verifier nodes - for transmission of potential faults on chain
- relayer nodes - for forwarding and discarding messages appropriately.

The message pool subsystem is made of two components:

- The [Message Syncer](\missing-link) -- which receives and propagates messages.
- [Message Storage](\missing-link) -- which caches messages according to a given policy.

TODOs:

- discuss how messages are meant to propagate slowly/async
- explain algorithms for choosing profitable txns
