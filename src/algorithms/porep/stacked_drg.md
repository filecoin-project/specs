title: Stacked DRG PoRep
---

This section describes *Stacked DRG PoRep* (SDR), the specific Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) used in Filecoin. In this construction, the prover encodes the original data into a replica and commits to it. An offline PoRep proves that the commitment to the replica is a valid commitment of the encoded original data.

SDR has been presented by [Ben Fisch at EUROCRYPT19](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/702.pdf).

# Introduction

## Background on Proof-of-Replication
*Proof-of-Replication* enables a prover *P* to convince a verifier *V* that *P* is storing a replica *R*, a physically independent copy of some data *D*, unique to *P*. The scheme is defined by a tuple of polynomial time algorithms (_Setup_, Replication, _Prove_, _Verify_). The assumption is that generation of a replica after _Replicate_  must be difficult (if not impossible) to generate.

- *Setup*: On setup, the public parameters of the proving systems are set.
- *Replicate*: On replication, either a party or both (depending on the scheme, in our case the prover only!) generate a unique permutation of the original data _D_, which we call replica _R_.
- _Prove_: On receiving a challenge, the prover must generate a proof that it is in possession of the replica and that it was derived from data _D_. The prover must only be able to respond to the challenge successfully if it is in possession of the replica, since would be difficult (if not impossible) to generate a replica that can be used to generate the proof at this stage
- _Verify_: On receiving the proof, the verifier checks the validity of the proof and accepts or rejects the proof.

## Time-bounded Proof-of-Replication

**Timing assumption**. *Time-bounded Proof-of-Replication* are constructions of PoRep with timing assumptions. The assumption is that generation of the replica (hence the _Replication_) takes some time _t_ that is substantially larger than the time it takes to produce a proof (hence _time(Prove)_) and the round-trip time (_RTT_) for sending a challenge and receiving a proof.

**Distinguishing Malicious provers**. A malicious prover that does not have _R_, must obtain it (or generate it), before the _Prove_ step. A verifier can distinguish an honest prover from a malicious prover, since the malicious one will take too long to answer the challenge. A verifier will reject if receiving the proof from the prover takes longer than a timeout (bounded between proving time and replication time).

## Background on Stacked DRG PoRep

*Stacked DRG PoRep* (SDR) is a specific Proof-of-Replication construction that we use in Filecoin. SDR has been designed by [Ben Fisch at EUROCRYPT19](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/702.pdf).  At a high level, SDR ensures that the *Replicate* step is a slow non-parallelizable sequential process by using a special type of graph called Depth Robust Graphs (DRG).


**Encoding using DRGs**. A key is generated by sequentially labeling nodes in the graph such that each label depends on the labels of its parents. The depth robustness property of these graphs ensure that the sequential labeling steps are not parallelizable. The final labels are used as a key to encode the original data.

TODO: This probably needs a more thorough rewrite.

** Stacked DRGs**. SDR builds on the above by stacking DRG graphs into `LAYERS` layers. Each layer is connected to the previous by a Bipartite Expander Graph. The combination of DRGs and expander graphs guarantee the security property of PoRep. As before, the key produced by the final layer is used to encode the original data, yielding the replica.

**Generating SDR proofs**. Given the following public parameters:

- `ReplicaId` is a unique replica identifier (see the Filecoin Proofs spec for details).
- `CommD` is the Merkle tree root hash of the input data to the first layer.
- `CommC` is the Merkle tree root hash of the SDR column commitments.
- `CommRLast` is the Merkle tree root hash of the replica.
- `CommR` is the on-chain commitment to the replica, dervied as the hash of the concatenation of `CommC` and `CommRLast`.


An SDR proof proves that some data whose committment is `CommD` has been used to run a `Replicate` algorithm and generated some data. `CommR` is the on-chain commitment to both the replicated data and to intermediate stages required to prove `Replicate` was performed correctly.

An SDR proof consists of a set of challenged DRG nodes for each layer, a set of parent nodes for each challenged node and a Merkle tree inclusion proof for each node provided. The verifier can then verify the correct labeling of each node and that the nodes given were consistent with the prover's commitments.

**Making proofs succinct with SNARKs**: The proof size in SDR is too large for blockchain usage (~100MB TODO: check this), mostly due to the large amount of Merkle tree inclusion proofs required to achieve security. We use SNARKs to generate a proof of knowledge of a correct SDR proof. In other words, we implement the SDR proof verification algorithm in an arithmetic circuit and use SNARKs to prove that it was evaluated correctly.

The SNARK circuit proves that given Merkle roots `CommD`, and `CommR`, the prover correctly derived the labels at each layer and correctly performed the final encoding.

## PoRep in Filecoin

Proof-of-Replication proves that a Storage Miner is dedicating unique storage for each ***sector***. Filecoin Storage Miners collect new clients' data in a sector, run a slow encoding process (called `Seal`) and generate a proof (`SealProof`) that the encoding was generated correctly.

In Filecoin, PoRep provides two guarantees: (1) *space-hardness*: Storage Miners cannot lie about the amount of space they are dedicating to Filecoin in order to gain more power in the consensus; (2) *replication*: Storage Miners are dedicating unique storage for each copy of their clients data.

Glossary:

- __*sector:*__ a fixed-size block of data of `SECTOR_SIZE` bytes which generally contains clients' data.
- __*unsealed sector:*__ a concrete representation (on disk or in memory) of a sector's that follows the "Storage Format" described in [Client Data Processing](client-data.md#storage-format) (currently `paddedfr32v1` is the required default).
- __*sealed sector:*__  a concrete representation (on disk or in memory) of the unique replica generated by `Seal` from an __*unsealed sector*__. A sector contains one or more ***pieces***.
- __*piece:*__ a block of data of at most `SECTOR_SIZE` bytes which is generally a client's file or part of.

### RepHash

`RepHash` is a vector commitment used to generate commitments to sealed sectors, unsealed sectors, piece commitments and intermediate stepds of the Proof-of-Replication. Filecoin uses a balanced binary Merkle tree for `RepHash`. The leaves of the Merkle tree are pairs of adjacent nodes.

`RepHash` inputs MUST respect a valid Storage Format. [TODO: What does this mean?]

## Stacked DRG Graph

The slow sequential encoding required is enforced by the depth robusness property of the SDR graph.

**Encoding with SDR**: The data from a sector (of size `SECTOR_SIZE`) is divided in `NODE_SIZE` nodes (for a total of `GRAPH_SIZE` nodes) and arranged in a directed acyclic graph. The structure of the graph is used to label the nodes sequentially to generate a key with which to encode the original data: in order to label a node, its parents must be labeled (see the "Layer Labeling" section below). We repeat this process for `LAYERS` layers, where the input to a next layer is the output of the previous one.

**Generating the SDR graph**: The SDR graph is divided in `LAYERS` layers. Each layer is a directed acyclic graph and it combines a Depth Robust Graph (DRG) and a Bipartite Expander graph. [TODO: this isn't quite right.]

We provide an algorithm (`SDR`) which computes the parents of a node. In high level, the parents of a node are computed by combining two algorithms: some parents (`BASE_DEGREE` of them) are computed via the `BucketSample` algorithm extended with a direct ordering of nodes, others (`EXPANSION_DEGREE` of them) are computed via the `Chung` algorithm. 

### `SDRGraph`: SDR Graph algorithm

Overview: Compute the DRG and Bipartite Expander parents using respectively `BucketSample` and `ChungExpander`.

#### Inputs

| name    | description                                       | Type   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `node`  | The node for which the parents are being computed | `uint` |
| `layer` | The layer of the SDR graph                        | `uint` |

#### Outputs

| name      | description                                 | Type                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `parents` | The ordered parents of node `node` on layer `layer` | `[PARENTS_COUNT]uint` |

#### Algorithm

- If `layer = 1`:
  - Compute `drgParents = BucketSample(node)`
  - Set `parents` to be `drgParents`.

- If `layer > 1`:
  - Compute `drgParents = BucketSample(node)`
  - Compute `expanderParents = ChungExpander(node)`
  - Set `parents` to be the concatenation of `drgParents` and `expanderParents`

We provide below a more succinct representation of the algorithm:

TODO: Reference to code in filproofs/algorithms.go  — or restructure all this.

#### Time-space tradeoff

Computing the parents using both `BucketSample` and `ChungExpander` for every layer can be an expensive operation, however, this can be avoided by caching the parents.

### `BucketSample`: Depth Robust Graphs algorithm

This section describes how to compute the "base parents" of the SDR graph, which is the equivalent of computing the parents of a Depth Robust Graph.

The properties of DRG graphs guarantee that a sector has been encoded with a slow, non-parallelizable process. We use the `BucketSample` algorithm that is based on DRSample ([ABH17](https://acmccs.github.io/papers/p1001-alwenA.pdf)) and described in [FBGB18](https://web.stanford.edu/~bfisch/porep_short.pdf) and generates a directed acyclic graph of in-degree `BASE_DEGREE`.

`BucketSample` DRG graphs are random graphs that can be deterministically generated from a seed; different seed lead with high probability to different graphs. In SDR, we use the same seed `GRAPH_SEED` for each layer of the SDR graph such that they are all based on the same underlying DRG graph.

The parents of any node can be locally computed without computing the entire graph. We call the parents of a node calculated in this way *base parents*.

`BucketSample` extends `BucketSampleInner` to include the node's 'immediate predecessor'. Each node except the first in a
DRG generated by `BucketSample` has the node whose index is one less than its own as a parent. This ensures that
visiting nodes whose indexes are sequential will result in a graph traversal in topological order.

### `ChungExpander`: Bipartite Expander Graphs

TODO: explain why we link nodes in the current layer

Each node in layers other than the first has `EXPANSION_DEGREE` parents generated via the `ChungExpander`
algorithm. Note that the indexes returned refer to labels from the *previous* layer. TODO: Make this all clearer with explicit notation.

// TODO: link to relevant filproofs/algorithms.go

#### Time-Space tradeoff

Computing these parents can be expensive (especially due to the hashing required by the Feistel algorithm). A miner can trade this computation by storing the expansion parents.

#### Feistel construction

We use three rounds of `Feistel` to generate a permutation to compute the parents of the Bipartite Expander graph.

TODO: link to filproofs/feistel

# Replication

> The Replication phase turns an *unsealed sector* into a *sealed sector* by first *generating a key*, then using the key to *encode the orignal data*.

Before running the `Replicate` algorithm, the prover must ensure that the sector is correctly formatted with a valid "Storage Format" described in [Filecoin Client Data Processing](client-data.md#storage-format) (currently `paddedfr32v1` is the required default).

TODO: inputs are missing

The Replication Algorithm  proceeds as follows:

- Calculate `ReplicaID` using `Hash` (Blake2s):

`ReplicaID` is a 32-byte array constructed by hashing the concatenation of the following values
- `ProverId` is a 32-byte array uniquely identifying a prover.
- `SectorNumber` is an unsigned 64-bit integer in little-endian encoding represented as an 8-byte array.
- `RandomSeed` is a 32-byte array of randomness extracted from the chain.
- `CommD` is the Merkle root obtained by performing `RepHash` on the original data represented in `paddedfr32v1`.

```
ReplicaID := Hash(ProverID || SectorNumber || RandomSeed || CommD)
```

- Perform `RepHash` on `Data` to yield `CommD` and `TreeD`:
```
CommD, TreeD = RepHash(data)
```


## Layer Labeling

TODO: Define `Graph`. We need to decide if this is an object we'll explicitly define or if its properties (e.g., `GRAPH_SIZE`) are just part of the replication parameters and all the functions just refer to the _same_ graphs being manipulated across the entire replication process. (At the moment I've avoided defining a `Graph` structure as in other specs I didn't see any object methods, just standalone functions.)
