{{<label randomness>}}

Randomness is used throughout the protocol in order to generate values and extend the blockchain.
Random values are drawn from the {{<sref ticket_chain>}} and appropriately formatted for usage.
We describe this formatting below.

## Encoding On-chain data for randomness

Any randomness derived from on-chain values uses the following encodings to represent these values as bytes:

- **Bytes**: Bytes
- **Ints**: Big-endian uint64 representation
- **Strings**: ASCII
- **Objects**: Their specified Serialization, currently CBOR-based serialization defined on algebraic datatypes

## Domain Separation Tags

For {{<sref crypto_signatures>}} as well as {{<sref vrf>}} usage in the protocol, we define Domain Separation Tags with which we prepend random inputs.

The source of truth is defined below, but the currently defined DSTs are:

- for drawing randomness from an on-chain ticket:
    - `TicketDrawingDST = 1`
- for generating a new random ticket:
    - `TicketProductionDST = 2`
- for generating randomness for running ElectionPoSt:
    - `ElectionPoStChallengeSeedDST = 3`
- for generating randomness for running SurprisePoSt:
    - `SurprisePoStChallengeSeedDST = 4`
- for selection of which miners to surprise:
    - `SurprisePoStSelectMinersDST = 5`
- for selection of which sectors to sample:
	- `SurprisePoStSampleSectors = 6`

## Forming Randomness Seeds

Different uses of randomness require randomness seeds predicated on a variety of inputs. For instance, we have:

- `TicketDrawing` -- uses ticket and epoch number
- `TicketProduction` -- uses ticket and miner actor addr
- `PoStChallengeSeed` -- uses ticket and miner actor addr
- `SurprisePoStSelectMiners` -- uses ticket and epoch number
...

In all cases, a ticket is used as the base of randomness (see {{<sref tickets>}}). In order to make randomness seed creation uniform, the protocol derives all such seeds in the same way, as follows (also see {{<sref tickets>}}):
```text
 For a given ticket's randomness ticket_randomness:

buffer = Bytes{}
buffer.append(IntToBigEndianBytes(AppropriateDST))
buffer.append(-1) // a flag to be used in cases where FIL might need longer randomness outputs. Currently unused
buffer.append(ticket_randomness)
buffer.append(other needed serialized inputs)

randomness = SHA256(buffer)
```
