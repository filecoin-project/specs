{{<label sector>}}

The `Sector` is a fundamental "storage container" abstraction used in Filecoin Storage Mining. It is the basic unit of storage,
and serves to make storage conform to a set of expectations.

New sectors are empty upon creation. As the miner receives client data, they fill or "pack" the piece(s) into an unsealed sector.

Once a sector is full, the unsealed sector is combined by a proving tree into a single root `UnsealedSectorCID`. The sealing process then encodes (using CBOR) an unsealed sector into a sealed sector, with the root `SealedSectorCID`.

This diagram shows the composition of an unsealed sector and a sealed sector.
