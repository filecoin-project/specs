title: VM Interpreter - Message Invocation (Outside VM)
---

The VM interpreter orchestrates the execution of messages from a tipset on that tipset's parent state,
producing a new state and a sequence of message receipts. The CIDs of this new state and of the receipt
collection are included in blocks from the subsequent epoch, which must agree about those CIDs 
in order to form a new tipset.

The messages from all the blocks in a tipset must be executed in order to produce a next state.
All messages from the first block are executed before those of second and subsequent blocks in the
tipset. For each block, BLS-aggregated messages are executed first, then SECP signed messages.

In addition, for each block:

- the block reward is paid to the miner owner account, and 
- the block producer's election PoSt is processed by an implicit invocation on the associated actor  

via implicit messages before that block's explicit messages are executed. 

For each tipset:

- the `CronActor`'s tick method is invoked implicitly after all the blocks' messages.

These implicit messages specify a gas price of zero, but must be included in the computation.
They must succeed (have an exit code of zero) in order for the new state to be
computed. Receipts for them are excluded from the receipt list; only explicit messages have an 
explicit receipt. 

The gas payment for each message execution is paid to the miner owner account immediately after
that message is executed. There are no encumbrances to either the block reward or gas fees earned: 
both may be spent immediately, including by a message in the same block in which they are earned.  

Since different miners produce blocks in the same epoch, multiple blocks in a single tipset may 
include the same message (identified by the same CID). 
When this happens, the message is processed only the first time it is encountered in the tipset's
canonical order. Subsequent instances of the message are ignored and do not result in any 
state mutation or produce a receipt. 

The sequence of executions for a tipset is thus summarised:

- pay reward for first block
- process election post for first block
- messages for first block (BLS before SECP)
- pay reward for second block
- process election post for second block
- messages for second block (BLS before SECP, skipping any already encountered)
- [... subsequent blocks ...]
- cron tick 

# Message validity and failure
Every message in a valid block can be processed and produce a receipt (note that block validity
implies all messages are syntactically valid and correctly signed). However, execution may
or may not succeed, depending on the state to which the message is applied. If the execution
of a message fails, the corresponding receipt will carry a non-zero exit code. 

If a message fails due to a reason that can reasonably be attributed to the miner including a
message that could never have succeeded in the parent state, or because the sender lacks funds
to cover the maximum message cost, then the miner pays a penalty by burning the gas fee 
(rather than the sender paying fees to the block miner).

The only state changes resulting from a message failure are either:

- incrementing of the sending actor's `CallSeqNum`, and payment of gas fees from the sender to the owner of the miner of the block including the message; or
- a penalty equivalent to the gas fee for the failed message, burnt by the miner (sender's `CallSeqNum` unchanged).
 
A message execution will fail if, in the immediately preceding state:

- the `From` actor does not exist in the state (miner penalized),
- the `From` actor is not an account actor (miner penalized),
- the `CallSeqNum` of the message does not match the `CallSeqNum` of the `From` actor (miner penalized),
- the `To` actor does not exist in state and the `To` address is not a pubkey-style address (miner penalized),
- the `To` actor does not exist in state and the message has a non-zero `MethodNum` (miner penalized),
- the `To` actor exists but does not have a method corresponding to the non-zero `MethodNum`,
- deserialized `Params` is not an array of length matching the arity of the `To` actor's `MethodNum` method,
- deserialized `Params` are not valid for the types specified by the `To` actor's `MethodNum` method,
- the `From` actor does not have sufficient balance to cover the sum of the message `Value` plus the
maximum gas cost, `GasLimit * GasPrice` (miner penalized),
- the invoked method consumes more gas than the `GasLimit` allows, or
- the invoked method exits with a non-zero code (via `Runtime.Abort()`).

Note that if the `To` actor does not exist in state and the address is a valid `H(pubkey)` address, 
it will be created as an account actor (only if the message has a MethodNum of zero).
