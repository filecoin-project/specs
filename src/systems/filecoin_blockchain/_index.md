The Filecoin Blockchain is a distributed virtual machine that achieves consensus, processes messages, accounts for storage, and maintains security in the Filecoin Protocol. It is the main interface linking various actors in the Filecoin system.

It includes:

- A {{<sref message_pool>}} subsystem that nodes use to track and propagate messages related to the storage market throughout a gossip network.
- A {{<sref sys_vm>}} subsystem used to interpret and execute messages in order to update system state.
- A {{<sref state_tree>}} subsystem which manages the creation and maintenance of state trees (the system state) deterministically generated by the vm from a given subchain.
- A {{<sref chain_sync>}} susbystem that tracks and propagates validated message blocks, maintaining sets of candidate chains on which the miner may mine and running syntactic validation on incoming blocks.
- A {{<sref storage_power_consensus>}} subsystem which tracks {{<sref storage_mining_subsystem "storage">}} state for a given chain and helps the blockchain system choose subchains to extend and blocks to include in them.

And also:

- A {{ <sref chain_manager> }} -- which maintains a given chain's state, providing facilities to other blockchain subsystems which will query state about the latest chain in order to run, and ensuring incoming blocks are semantically validated before inclusion into the chain.
- A {{ <sref block_producer> }} -- which is called in the event of a successful leader election in order to produce a new block that will extend the current heaviest chain before forwarding it to the syncer for propagation.

At a high-level, the Filecoin blockchain grows through successive rounds of leader election in which a number of miners are elected to generate a block, whose inclusion in the chain will earn them block rewards. 
Filecoin's blockchain runs on storage power. That is, its consensus algorithm by which miners agree on which subchain to mine is predicated on the amount of storage backing that subchain. At a high-level, the {{<sref storage_power_consensus>}} subsystem maintains a _Power Table_ that tracks the amount of storage {{<sref storage_mining_subsystem "storage miner actors">}} have contributed to the network through _Sector commitments_ and _Proofs of Spacetime_.

Most of the functions of the Filecoin blockchain system are detailed in the code below.
