      <description>Signatures are cryptographic functions that attest to the origin of a particular message. In the context of Filecoin, signatures are used to send and receive messages among with the assurance that each message was generated by specific individuals. In other words, it is infeasible for another individual i to generate a signed message that appears to have been generated by j.
We use signatures in filecoin to verify something was done by someone.</description>
