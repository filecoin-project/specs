# Filecoin Network Protocols

All filecoin network protocols are implemented as libp2p protocols. This document will assume that all data is communicated between peers on a libp2p stream.

## CBOR RPC

Filecoin uses many pre-existing protocols from ipfs and libp2p, and also implements several new protocols of its own. For these Filecoin specific protocols, we will use the CBOR RPC protocol format, defined below.

This format consists of series of [CBOR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049) serialized objects. Whenever a filecoin protocol says "send X", it means "cbor serialize the object X, then write the serialized bytes".


## Hello Handshake

- **Name**: Hello
- **Protocol ID**: `/fil/hello/1.0.0`

Note: Implementations should limit the maximum number of bytes read during the `ReadCborRPC`Â call. We suggest 1MB as a sane limit.

# Hello Handshake

> The Hello protocol is used when two filecoin nodes initially connect to eachother in order to determine information about the other node.

Whenever a node gets a new connection, it opens a new stream on that connection and "says hello". This is done by crafting a `HelloMessage`, sending it to the other peer using CBOR RPC and finally, closing the stream.

```go
type HelloMessage struct {
	HeaviestTipSet       []Cid
	HeaviestTipSetWeight uint64
	GenesisHash          Cid
}
```

```go
func SayHello(p PeerID) {
	s := OpenStream(p)
	mes := GetHelloMessage()
	WriteCborRPC(s, mes)
	s.Close()
}
```

Upon receiving a "hello" stream from another node, you should read off the CBOR RPC message, and then check that the genesis hash matches you genesis hash. If it does not, that node is not part of your network, and should probably be disconnected from. Next, the `HeaviestTipSet`, claimed `HeaviestTipSetWeight`, and peerID of the other node should be passed to the chain sync subsystem.

## Storage Deal

- **Name**: Storage Deal
- **Protocol ID**: `/fil/storage/mk/1.0.0`

> The storage deal protocol is used by any client to store data with a storage miner.

The protocol starts with storage client (which in this case may be a normal storage client, or a broker). It is assumed that the client has their data already prepared into a `piece` prior to executing this protocol. For more details on initial data processing, see [client data](client-data.md).

First the client sends a `SignedStorageDealProposal` to the storage miner:

```go
type Commitment []byte

type StorageDealProposal struct {
	// PieceRef is the hash of the data in native structure. This will be used for
	// certifying the data transfer
	PieceRef Cid

	// SerializationMode specifies how the graph referenced by 'PieceRef' gets transformed
	// into the data that will be packed into a sector.
	SerializationMode string

	// CommP is the data hashed in a form that is compatible with the proofs system
	// TODO: this *could* possibly be combined with the PieceRef
	CommP Commitment

	Size NumBytes

	TotalPrice TokenAmount

	// Duration is how long the file should be stored for
	Duration NumBlocks

	// PaymentRef is a reference to the mechanism that the proposer
	// will use to pay the miner. It should be verifiable by the
	// miner using on-chain information.
	Payment PaymentInfo

	// MinerAddress is the address of the storage miner in the deal proposal
	MinerAddress Address

	ClientAddress Address
}

type SignedStorageDealProposal struct {	
	Proposal StorageDealProposal

	// Signature over the cbor encoded StorageDealProposal signed by client
	Signature Signature
}

type PaymentInfo struct {
	// PayChActor is the address of the payment channel actor
	// that will be used to facilitate payments
	PayChActor Address

	// Payer is the address of the owner of the payment channel
	Payer Address

	// Channel is the ID of the specific channel the client will
	// use to pay the miner. It must already have sufficient funds locked up
	Channel ChannelID

	// ChannelMsgCid is the B58 encoded CID of the message used to create the
	// channel. Adding the message cid allows the miner to wait until the
	// channel is accepted on chain.
	ChannelMsgCid cid.Cid

	// Vouchers is a set of payments from the client to the miner that can be
	// cashed out contingent on the agreed upon data being provably within a
	// live sector in the miners control on-chain
	Vouchers []PaymentVouchers
}
```

### Deal State Values

Legal values for `DealState` are as follows:

| State | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Unset | `0`   | This implies a programmer error and should never appear in an actual message. |
| Unknown | `1` | Signifies an unknown negotiation. |
| Rejected | `2` | The deal was rejected for some reason. |
| Accepted | `3` | The deal was accepted but hasn't yet started. |
| Started | `4` | Tthe deal has started and the transfer is in progress. |
| Failed | `5` | The deal has failed for some reason. |
| Staged | `6` | The data has been received and staged into a sector, but is not sealed yet. |
| Complete | `7` | Deal is complete, and the sector that the deal is contained in has been sealed and its commitment posted on chain. |


```go
func SendStorageProposal(miner Address, file Cid, duration NumBlocks, price TokenAmount) {
	if !IsMiner(miner) {
		Fatal("given address was not a miner")
	}

	// Get a PoRep friendly commitment from the file
	commitment, size := ProcessRef(file)

	// Get a handle on the payment system to be used to pay this miner
	// Most likely, this grabs an existing payment channel, or creates
	// a new one
	payments := PaymentSysToMiner(miner)

	payInfo := payments.CreatePaymentInfo(storageStart, duration, price*size)

	prop := StorageDealProposal{
		PieceRef:      file,
		CommP: commitment,
		TotalPrice:    price * size, // Maybe just leave this to the payment info?
		Duration:      duration,
		Size:          size,
		Payment:       payInfo,
	}

	client.SignProposal(prop)

	peerid := lookup.ByMinerAddress(miner)
	s := NewStream(peerid, MakeStorageDealProtocolID)

	// Send the proposal over
	CborRpc.Write(s, prop)

	// Read the response...
	resp := CborRpc.Read(s)

	switch resp.State {
	case Accepted:
		// Yay! the miner accepted our deal, prepare to send them the file, and then check back
		// later to see how its going
	case Rejected:
		// oh no, our deal was rejected.
		// practically, we should consider whether or not to close our payment channel
		Fatal("Deal rejected, reason: ", resp.Message)
	default:
		// unexpected response state...
	}
}
```

{{% notice todo %}}
**TODO**: possibly also include a starting block height here, to indicate when this deal may be started (implying you could select a value in the future). After the first response, both parties will have signed agreeing that the deal started at that point. This could possibly be used to challenge either party in the event of a stall. This starting block height also gives the miner time to seal and post the commitment on chain. Otherwise a weird condition exists where a client could immediately slash a miner for not having their data stored.
{{% /notice %}}

The miner then decides whether or not to accept the deal, and sends back a SignedStorageDealResponse:

```go
type StorageDealResponse struct {
	State DealState

	// Message is an optional message to add context to any given response
	Message string

	// ProposalCid is the cid of the StorageDealProposal object this response is for
	ProposalCid Cid

	// PieceInclusionProof is a collection of information needed to convince the client that
	// the miner has sealed the data into a sector.
	// Note: the miner doesnt necessarily have to have committed the sector at this point
	// they just need to have staged it into a sector, and be committed to putting it at
	// that place in the sector.
	PieceInclusionProof PieceInclusionProof

	// SectorCommitMsg is the Cid of the message that was sent to submit
	// the sector containing this data to the chain.
	SectorCommitMsg Cid
}

type SignedStorageDealResponse struct {
	Response StorageDealResponse

	// Signature is a signature from the miner over the cbor encoded response
	Signature Signature
}
```

```go
func HandleStorageDealProposal(s Stream) {
	prop := CborRpc.Read(s)

	if !ValidateInput(prop) {
		Fatal("client sent invalid proposal")
	}

	if accept, reason := MinerPolicy.ShouldAccept(prop); !accept {
		CborRpc.Write(s, StorageDealResponse{
			State:   Rejected,
			Message: reason,
		})
		return
	}

	// Alright, we're accepting
	resp := StorageDealResponse{
		State:    Accepted,
		Proposal: prop.Cid(),
	}

	miner.Sign(resp)

	miner.SetDealState(resp)

	// Make sure we are ready to receive the file (however it may come)
	// TODO: potentially add in something to the protocol to allow
	// clients to signal how the file will be transferred
	miner.RegisterInboundFileTransfer(prop)

	CborRpc.Write(s, resp)
}

func ValidateInput(prop StorageDealProposal) {
	// Note: Maybe this is unnecessary, and the payment info being valid suffices?
	if !ValidateSignature(prop.Signature, prop.ClientAddress) {
		Fatal("invalid signature from client")
	}

	if !IsExistingAccount(prop.ClientAddress) {
		Fatal("proposal came from a fake account")
	}

	if !ValidatePaymentInfo(prop.Payment, prop.Duration, prop.Size) {
		Fatal("propsal had invalid payment information")
	}
}
```

If `response.State` is `Accepted` then the client should proceed to transfer the data in question to the storage miner. This operation happens out of band from this protocol, and can be a simple bitswap transfer at first. Support for other more 'exotic' 'protocols' such as mailing hard drives is an explicit goal.

Next, when the miner receives all the data and validates it, they set the `DealState` to `Staged`. When the sector gets sealed, and the commitment is posted on chain, the state gets set to `Complete` and the deals `PieceInclusionProof` field should be set to the appropriate values.

```go
func OnDataReceived(prop StorageDealProposal) {
	if !ValidatePieceTranslation(prop.PieceRef, prop.SerializationMode, prop.CommP) {
		resp := StorageDealResponse{
			State:    Rejected,
			Proposal: prop.Cid(),
			Message:  "CommP was invalid, reconstructed data did not match",
		}

		miner.Sign(resp)
		miner.SetDealState(resp)
		return
	}

	// TODO: is CommP actually needed? How does it tie in?
	SectorBuilder.AddPiece(prop.PieceRef, prop.SerializationMode)
}
```

```go
func OnSectorPacked(prop StorageDealProposal, pieceConf PieceCommitment) {
	resp := StorageDealResponse{
		State:             Staged,
		Proposal:          prop.Cid(),
		PieceInclusionProof: pieceConf,
	}

	miner.Sign(resp)
	miner.SetDealState(resp)
}
```

Once the deal makes it to the `Staged` state, the client should be able to query and get the `PieceInclusionProof` that they need to verify that the miner is indeed storing their data.

```go
func OnSectorSealed(prop StorageDealProposal, msgcid Cid) {
	curState := miner.GetDealState(prop)
	nstate := StorageDealResponse{
		State:             Complete,
		Proposal:          prop.Cid(),
		PieceInclusionProof: curState.PieceInclusionProof,
		SectorCommitMsg:   msgcid,
	}

	miner.Sign(nstate)
	miner.SetDealState(nstate)
}
```


### Query

Here we describe a basic protocol for querying the current state of a given storage deal. In the future we may want something more complex that is able to multiplex waiting for notifications about a large set of deals over a single stream simultaneously. Upgrading to that from this should be relatively simple, so for now, we do the simple thing.

The libp2p protocol ID for this protocol is `/fil/storage/qry/1.0.0`

At any point, the client in this flow may query the miner for the state of a given proposal. To query, they send a 'StorageDealQuery' that looks like this:

```go
type StorageDealQuery struct {
	// ProposalCid is the cid of the proposal for the deal that we are querying
	// the state of
	ProposalCid *cid.Cid

	BaseState DealState
}
```

If `BaseState` is `Unset` or a terminal state (`Complete`, `Rejected`, or `Failed`) then the current state of the deal in question is returned. If the `BaseState` is different than the current state of the deal, the current state of the deal is also returned immediately. In the case that the `BaseState` matches the current state of the deal, then the stream is held open until the state changes, at which point the new state of the deal is returned.


## Retrieve Piece for Free

- **Name**: Retrieve Piece for Free
- **Protocol ID**: `/fil/retrieval/free/0.0.0`

> The Retrieve Piece for Free protocol is used to coordinate the transfer of a piece from miner to client at no cost to the client.

The client initiates the protocol by opening a libp2p stream to the miner. To find and connect to the miner, the [address lookup service](lookup-service.md) should be used. Once connected, the client must send the miner a `RetrievePieceRequest` message using the [CBOR RPC](#CBOR-RPC) protocol format.

The `RetrievePieceRequest` is specified as follows:

```go
type RetrievePieceRequest struct {
	// `PieceRef` identifies a piece of user data, typically received from the
	// client while consummating a storage deal.
	PieceRef *cid.Cid
}
```

When the miner receives the request, it responds with a `RetrievePieceResponse` message indicating that it has accepted or rejected the request.

The `RetrievePieceResponse` message is specified as follows:

```go
type RetrievePieceResponse struct {
	// `Status` communicates the miner's willingness to send a piece back to a
	// client. The value of the `Status` field must be one of: `Failure` or
	// `Success`.
	Status RetrievePieceStatus

	// If `Status` is `Failure`, `ErrorMessage` should contain a string
	// explaining the cause for the rejection.
	ErrorMessage string
}
```

Legal values for `RetrievePieceStatus` are as follows:

```go
const (
	// Unset implies a programmer error. This value should never appear in an
	// actual message.
	Unset = RetrievePieceStatus(iota)

	// Failure indicates that the piece can not be retrieved from the miner.
	Failure

	// Success means that the piece can be retrieved from the miner.
	Success
)
```

If the miner does not accept the request, it sends a `RetrievePieceResponse` with the `Status` field set to `Failure`. The miner should set the `ErrorMessage` field to indicate a reason for the request being rejected.

If the miner accepts the request, it sends a `RetrievePieceResponse` with the `Status` field set to `Success`. The miner then sends the client ordered `RetrievePieceChunk` messages until all of the piece's data has been transferred, at which point the miner closes the stream.

Note: The client must be able to reconstruct a piece by concatenating the `Data`-bytes in the order that they were received.

Note: The miner divides the piece in to chunks containing a maximum of `256 << 8` bytes due to a limitation in our software which caps the size of CBOR-encoded messages at `256 << 10` bytes.

The `RetrievePieceChunk` message is specified as follows:

```go
type RetrievePieceChunk struct {
	// The `Data` field contains a chunk of a piece. The length of `Data` must
	// be > 0.
	Data []byte
}
```

## BlockSync

The blocksync protocol is a small protocol that allows Filecoin nodes to request ranges of blocks from each other. It is a simple request/response protocol with a protocol ID of `/fil/sync/blk/0.0.1`. It uses CBOR-RPC.

```go
type BlockSyncRequest struct {
    // The TipSet being synced from
	Start         []Cid
    // How many tipsets to sync
	RequestLength uint64
    // Query options
    Options uint64
}
```

The request requests a chain of a given length by the hash of its highest block. The `Options` allow the requester to specify whether or not blocks and messages to be included.

| bit  | option   | Description             |
| ---- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| `0`    | Blocks   | Include blocks if set   |
| `1`    | Messages | Include messages if set |


```go
type BlockSyncResponse struct {
	Chain []TipSetBundle
	Status  uint
	Message string
}

type TipSetBundle struct {
  Blocks []Blocks
  Messages []Message
  MsgIncludes [][]int
}
```

The response contains the requested chain in reverse iteration order. Each item in the `Chain` array contains the blocks for that tipset if the `Blocks` option bit in the request was set, and if the `Messages` bit was set, the messages across all blocks in that tipset. The `MsgIncludes` array contains one array of integers for each block in the `Blocks` array. Each of the arrays in `MsgIncludes` contains a list of indexes of messages from the `Messages` array that are in each `Block` in the blocks array.

### Example

The TipSetBundle

```
Blocks: [b0, b1]
Messages: [mA, mB, mC, mD]
MsgIncludes: [[0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 0]]
```

corresponds to:

```
Block 'b0': [mA, mB, mD]
Block 'b1': [mB, mC, mA]
```

### Error Codes

| Name | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Success | `0`| All is well. |
| PartialResponse | `101` | Sent back fewer blocks than requested. |
| BlockNotFound | `201` | Request.Start not found |
| GoAway | `202` | Requester is making too many requests. |
| InternalError | `203` | Internal error occured.|
