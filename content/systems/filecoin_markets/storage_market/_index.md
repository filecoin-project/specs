# Storage Market in Filecoin

Storage Market subsystem is the data entry point into the network. Storage miners only earn power from data stored in a storage deal and all deals live on the Filecoin network. Specific deal negotiation process happens off chain, clients and miners enter a storage deal after an agreement has been reached and post storage deals on the Filecoin network to earn block rewards and get paid for storing the data in the storage deal. A deal is only valid when it is posted on chain with signatures from both parties and at the time of posting, there are sufficient balances for both parties locked up to honor the deal in terms of deal price and deal collateral.

## Terminology

- **StorageClient** - The party that wants to make a deal to store data
- **StorageProvider** - The party that will store the data in exchange for payment. A storage miner.
- **StorageMarketActor** - The on-chain component of deals. The StorageMarketActor is analogous to an escrow and a ledger for all deals made.
- **StorageAsk** - The current price and parameters a miner is currently offering for storage (analogous to an Ask in a financial market)
- **StorageDealProposal** - A proposal for a storage deal, signed only by the - `Storage client`
- **StorageDeal** - A storage deal proposal with a counter signature from the Provider, which then goes on-chain.

## Deal Flow

The lifecycle for a deal within the storage market contains distinct phases:

1. **Discovery** - The client identifies miners and determines their current asks.
2. **Negotiation** (out of band) - Both parties come to an agreement about the terms of the deal, each party commits funds to the deal and data is transferred from the client to the provider.
4. **Publishing** - The deal is published on chain, making the storage provider publicly accountable for the deal.
5. **Handoff** - Once the deal is published, it is handed off and handled by the Storage Mining Subsystem. The Storage Mining Subsystem will add the data corresponding to the deal to a sector,
seal the sector, and tell the Storage Market Actor that the deal is in a sector, thereby marking the deal as active.

From that point on, the deal is handled by the Storage Mining Subsystem, which communicates with the Storage Market Actor in order to process deal payments. See [Storage Mining Subsystem](storage_mining) for more details.

The following diagram outlines the phases of deal flow within the storage market in detail:

## Discovery

Discovery is the client process of identifying storage providers (i.e. a miner) who (subject to agreement on the deal's terms) are offering to store the client's data. There are many ways which a client can use to identify a provider to store their data. The list below outlines the minimum discovery services a filecoin implementation MUST provide. As the network evolves, third parties may build systems that supplement or enhance these services.

Discovery involves identifying providers and determining their current `StorageAsk`. The steps are as follows:
1. A client queries the chain to retrieve a list of Storage Miner Actors who have registerd as miners with the StoragePowerActor.
2. A client may perform additional queries to each Storage Miner Actor to determine their properties. Among others, these properties can include worker address, sector size, libp2p Multiaddress etc.
3. Once the client identifies potentially suitable providers, it sends a direct libp2p message using the `Storage Query Protocol` to get each potential provider's current `StorageAsk`.
4. Miners respond on the `AskProtocol` with a signed version of their current `StorageAsk`.

A `StorageAsk` contains all the properties that a client will need to determine if a given provider will meet its needs for storage at this moment. Providers should update their asks frequently to ensure the information they are providing to clients is up to date.

## Negotiation

Negotiation is the out-of-band process during which a storage client and a storage provider come to an agreement about a storage deal and reach the point where a deal is published on chain.

Negotiation begins once a client has discovered a miner whose `StorageAsk` meets their desired criteria. The *recommended* order of operations for negotiating and publishing a deal is as follows:

1. In order to propose a storage deal, the `StorageClient` calculates the piece commitment (`CommP`) for the data it intends to store. This is neccesary so that the `StorageProvider` can verify that the data the `StorageClient` sends to be stored matches the `CommP` in the `StorageDealProposal`. For more detail about the relationship between payloads, pieces, and `CommP` see [Piece](piece).
2. Before sending a proposal to the provider, the `StorageClient` adds funds for a deal, as necessary, to the `StorageMarketActor` (by calling `AddBalance`).
3. The `StorageClient` now creates a `StorageDealProposal` and sends the proposal and the CID for the root of the data payload to be stored to the `StorageProvider` using the `Storage Deal Protocol`.

From this point onwards, execution moves to the `StorageProvider`.

4. The `StorageProvider` inspects the deal to verify that the deal's parameters match its own internal criteria (such as price, piece size, deal duration, etc). The `StorageProvider` rejects the proposal if the parameters don't match its own criteria by sending a rejection to the client over the
`Storage Deal Protocol`.
5. The `StorageProvider` queries the `StorageMarketActor` to verify the `StorageClient` has deposited enough funds to make the deal (i.e. the client's balance is greater than the total storage price) and rejects the proposal if it hasn't.
6. If all criteria are met, the `StorageProvider` responds using the `Storage Deal Protocol` to indicate an intent to accept the deal.

From this point onwards execution moves back to the `StorageClient`.

7. The `StorageClient` opens a push request for the payload data using the `Data Transfer Module`, and sends the request to the provider along with a voucher containing the CID for the `StorageDealProposal`.
8. The `StorageProvider` checks the voucher and verifies that the CID matches the storage deal proposal it has received and verified but not put on chain already. If so, it accepts the data transfer request from the `StorageClient`.
9. The `Data Transfer Module` now transfers the payload data to be stored from the  `StorageClient` to the `StorageProvider` using `GraphSync`.
10. Once complete, the `Data Transfer Module` notifies the `StorageProvider`.
11. The `StorageProvider` recalculates the piece commitment (`CommP`) from the data transfer that just completed and verifies it matches the piece commitment in the `StorageDealProposal`.

## Publishing

Data is now transferred, both parties have agreed, and it's time to publish the deal. Given that the counter signature on a deal proposal is a standard message signature by the provider and the signed deal is an on-chain message, it is usually the `StorageProvider` that publishes the deal. However, if `StorageProvider` decides to send this signed on-chain message to the client before calling `PublishStorageDeal` then the client can publish the deal on-chain. The client's funds are not locked until the deal is published and a published deal that is not activated within some pre-defined window will result in an on-chain penalty.

12. First, the `StorageProvider` adds collateral for the deal as needed to the `StorageMarketActor` (using `AddBalance`).
13. Then, the `StorageProvider` prepares and signs the on-chain `StorageDeal` message with the `StorageDealProposal` signed by the client and its own signature. It can now either send this message back to the client or call `PublishStorageDeals` on the `StorageMarketActor` to publish the deal. It is recommended for `StorageProvider` to send back the signed message before `PublishStorageDeals` is called.
14. After calling `PublishStorageDeals`, the `StorageProvider` sends a message to the `StorageClient` on the `Storage Deal Protocol` with the CID of the message that it is putting on chain for convenience.
15. If all goes well, the `StorageMarketActor` responds with an on-chain `DealID` for the published deal.

Finally, the `StorageClient` verifies the deal.

16. The `StorageClient` queries the node for the CID of the message published on chain (sent by the provider). It then inspects the message parameters to make sure they match the previously agreed deal.

## Handoff

Now that a deal is published, it needs to be stored, sealed, and proven in order for the provider to be paid. See Storage Deal for more information about how deal payments are made. These later stages of a deal are handled by the [Storage Mining Subsystem](storage_mining). So the final task for the Storage Market is to handoff to the Storage Mining Subsystem.

1.   The `StorageProvider` writes the serialized, padded piece to a shared [Filestore](filestore). 
2.   The `StorageProvider` calls `HandleStorageDeal` on the `StorageMiner` with the published `StorageDeal` and filestore path (in Go this is the `io.Reader`).

A note regarding the order of operations: the only requirement to publish a storage deal with the `StorageMarketActor` is that the `StorageDealProposal` is signed by the `StorageClient`, the publish message is signed by the `StorageProvider`, and both parties have deposited adequate funds/collateral in the `StorageMarketActor`. As such, it's not required that the steps listed above happen in this exact order. However, the above order is _recommended_ because it generally minimizes the ability of either party to act maliciously.

## Data Representation in the Storage Market

Data submitted to the Filecoin network go through several transformations before they come to the format at which the `StorageProvider` stores it. Here we provide a summary of these transformations.

1. When a piece of data, or file is submitted to Filecoin (in some raw system format) it is transformed into a _UnixFS DAG style data representation_ (in case it is not in this format already, e.g., from IPFS-based applications). The hash that represents the root of the IPLD DAG of the UnixFS file is the _Payload CID_, which is used in the Retrieval Market.
2. In order to make a _Filecoin Piece_ the UnixFS IPLD DAG is serialised into a .car file, which is also raw bytes.
3. The resulting .car file is _padded_ with some extra data.
4. The next step is to calculate the Merkle root out of the hashes of individual Pieces. The resulting root of the Merkle tree is the **Piece CID**. This is also referred to as **CommP**. Note that at this stage the data is still unsealed.
5. At this point, the Piece is included in a Sector together with data from other deals. The `StorageProvider` then calculates Merkle root for all the Pieces inside the sector. The root of this tree is _CommD_. This is the _unsealed sector CID_.
6. The `StorageProvider` is then sealing the sector and the root of the resulting Merkle root is the _CommR_.

The following data types are unique to the Storage Market:

## Storage Provider

The `StorageProvider` is a module that handles incoming queries for Asks and proposals for Deals from a `StorageClient`. It also tracks deals as they move through the deal flow, handling off chain actions during the negotiation phases of the deal and ultimately telling the `StorageMarketActor` to publish on chain. The `StorageProvider`'s last action is to handoff a published deal for storage and sealing to the Storage Mining Subsystem. Note that any address registered as a `StorageMarketParticipant` with the `StorageMarketActor` can be used with the `StorageClient`.

It is worth highlighting that a single participant can be a `StorageClient`, `StorageProvider`, or both at the same time.

Because most of what a Storage Provider does is respond to actions initiated by a `StorageClient`, most of its public facing methods relate to getting current status on deals, as opposed to initiating new actions. However, a user of the `StorageProvider` module can update the current Ask for the provider.

## Storage Client

The `StorageClient` is a module that discovers miners, determines their asks, and proposes deals to `StorageProviders`. It also tracks deals as they move through the deal flow. Note that any address registered as a `StorageMarketParticipant` with the `StorageMarketActor` can be used with the `StorageClient`.

Recall that a single participant can be a `StorageClient`, `StorageProvider`, or both at the same time.
