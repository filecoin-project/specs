# Storage Client

The `StorageClient` is a module that discovers miners, determines their asks, and proposes deals to `StorageProviders`. It also tracks deals as they move through the deal flow. Note that any address registered as a `StorageMarketParticipant` with the `StorageMarketActor` can be used with the `StorageClient`.

Recall that a single participant can be a `StorageClient`, `StorageProvider`, or both at the same time.
