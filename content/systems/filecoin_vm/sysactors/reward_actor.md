# RewardActor

The `RewardActor` is where unminted Filecoin tokens are kept. The `RewardActor` contains a `RewardMap` which is a mapping from owner addresses to `Reward` structs. 

A `Reward struct` is created to preserve the flexibility of introducing block reward vesting into the protocol. `MintReward` creates a new `Reward struct` and adds it to the `RewardMap`.

The award value used for the current epoch is updated at the end of an epoch through a cron tick. In the case previous epochs were null blocks this is the reward value as calculated at the last non-null epoch.
