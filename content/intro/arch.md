# Architecture Diagrams

## Overview Diagram
{{< details title="TODO" >}}
- cleanup / reorganize
  - this diagram is accurate, and helps lots to navigate, but it's still a bit confusing
  - the arrows and lines make it a bit hard to follow. We should have a much cleaner version (maybe based on [C4](https://c4model.com))
- reflect addition of Token system
  - move data_transfers into Token
