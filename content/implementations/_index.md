# Filecoin Implementations
---

Filecoin is targeting [multiple implementations](https://filecoin.io/blog/announcing-filecoin-implementations-in-rust-and-c++/) of the protocol in order to guarantee security but also resilience of the Filecoin network. There are currently four active implementation efforts:

- [Lotus](https://lotu.sh): the Go-based implementation, supported by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai),
- [Forest](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest): the Rust-based implementation, supported by [ChainSafe](https://chainsafe.io),
- [Fuhon](https://github.com/filecoin-project/cpp-filecoin): the C++-based implementation, supported by [Soramitsu](https://soramitsu.co.jp),
- [go-filecoin](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin): a second Go-based implementation of Filecoin, which is a community-driven effort.
