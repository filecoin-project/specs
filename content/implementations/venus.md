# Venus

Venus, previously called `go-filecoin`, is another implementation of Filecoin in Go and is maintained by the [IPFS Force Community](https://github.com/ipfs-force-community). The `go-filecoin` implementation, before it was renamed to Venus and taken over by IPFS Force, was already nearly feature-complete (as of June 2020) with `go-filecoin` nodes interoperating with Lotus nodes.

Protocol Labs is offering [DevGrants](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/140) to support the development of Venus.

You can find the Venus codebase [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus) and its extensive documentation website [here](https://go.filecoin.io/).
