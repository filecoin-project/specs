# Forest

Forest is an implementation of Filecoin written in Rust. The implementation will take a modular approach to building a full Filecoin node in two parts — (i) building Filecoin’s security critical systems in Rust from the Filecoin Protocol Specification, specifically the virtual machine, blockchain, and node system, and (ii) integrating functional components for storage mining and storage & retrieval markets to compose a fully functional Filecoin node implementation.

You can find the Forest codebase [here](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest) and the documentation site [here](https://chainsafe.github.io/forest/).

The Forest implementation of Filecoin is supported by [ChainSafe](https://chainsafe.io/).
