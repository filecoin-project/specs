# Signatures

Signatures are cryptographic functions that attest to the origin of a particular
message. In the context of Filecoin, signatures are used to send and receive
messages with the assurance that each message was generated by a specific
entity. In other words, it is infeasible for an entity i to
generate a signed message that appears to have been generated by j, with j != i.

Filecoin uses signatures to associate an action to a given party. For
example, Filecoin uses signatures in order to validate deal messages which represent an
action like a storage deal. 
Filecoin uses signatures to verify the authenticity of the following objects (non
exhaustive list):

- Messages: Users authenticate their transactions to the blockchain.
- Tickets: Miner authenticates its ticket (see [Storage Miner](filecoin_mining)).
- Blocks: Block leader signs over all data in the block. 

## Messages

To generate a signature for the [Message](message) type, compute the signature over the message's CID (taken as a byte array).

**Note**: for each specific use of a signature scheme, it is recommended to use a domain separation tag to treat the hash function as an independent random oracle. These tags are indicated in the relevant places throughout the specs.
Read more about this in [Randomness](randomness).

## Signature Types

Filecoin currently uses two types of signatures: 
- ECDSA signatures over the Secp256k1 elliptic curve to authenticate user
  transactions, mainly for compatibility with external blockchain systems.
- BLS signatures over the BLS12-381 group of curves 

Both signature types fulfill the `Signature` interface 
and each type have additional functionality as explained below.

### ECDSA Signatures

Filecoin uses the ECDSA signature algorithm over the secp256k1 curve to
authenticate the blockchain transactions. The main reason is to be able to
validate transactions from other blockchain systems that uses secp256k1 (such as
Bitcoin or exchanges in general). ECDSA signatures offer an additional
useful functionality as well: to recover the public key from a given signature.
This feature can allow space to be saved on the blockchain by extracting the public
key locally from the signature rather than specifying an ID of the public key.

**Wire Format**: Filecoin uses the standard secp256k1 signature serialization,
as described below. For more details on how the Filecoin `Signature` type is
serialized, see [Signature](signatures).

```text
SignatureBytes = [0x30][len][0x02][r][indicator][s][indicator][recovery]
```

`s` = Scalar of size 32 bytes

`r` = Compressed elliptic curve point (x-coordinate) of size 32 bytes

`recovery` = Information needed to recover a public key from `sig`.

- LSB(0) = parity of y-coordinate of r
- LSB(1) = overflow indicator

`indicator` = a 2 byte formatting indicator

### BLS Signatures

Filecoin uses the [BLS signature scheme](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-boneh-bls-signature/) over the [BLS12-381](https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/) group of elliptic curves. You can find the default Rust implementation in [Filecoin's repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/bls-signatures/).

**Choice of group**: The BLS signature requires the use of a pairing-equipped
curve which generally yield three groups: G_1, G_2 and G_T. In the BLS signature
scheme, there is a choice on which group to define the public key and the
signature:

- Public key is on G_1 and signature on G_2
- Public key is on G_2 and signature on G_1

The group G_1 is "smaller" and hence offer faster arithmetic operations and
smaller byte representation of its elements. Filecoin currently uses the group
**G_1 for representing public keys** and the group **G_2 for representing
signatures**.

**Wire Format**: Filecoin uses the standard way to serialize BLS signatures as
explained in the [RFC Section
2.6.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-boneh-bls-signature-00#section-2.6.1). 

**Rationale**: 
BLS signatures have two main characteristics that are making them ideal
candidates in recent blockchain systems:

- BLS signatures are deterministic: for a given message and a given secret key,
  the signature is always the same.  That feature removes an important security 
  weakness of most randomized signature schemes: signer must never re-use the
  same randomness twice otherwise this reveals its private key. As well,
  deterministic signatures are an ideal candidate to reduce the attack surface in
  terms of grinding, which is a real concern in recent proof of stake systems.
- BLS signatures are aggregatable: one can aggregate signatures from different
  signers into one single signature. This feature enables drastically saving
  space on the blockchain, especially when aggregating user transactions.

**Aggregation Functionality**: The aggregation functionality is commutative and
associative, enabling *partial* aggregation. For example, given
`(PK1, sig1), (PK2, sig2), (PK3, sig3)`, one can first aggregate `(PK12 = PK1 +
PK2, sig12 = sig1 + sig2)` then aggregate with the third tuple to produce
`(PK123 = PK12 + PK3, sig123 = sig12 + sig3)`.

**Aggregation Security**: The naive BLS signature aggregation scheme is
vulnerable to rogue-key attacks where the attacker can freely choose its public
key. To prevent against this class of attacks there exists three different kind
of measures, as explained [here](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/papers/BLSmultisig.html):

- Enforce distinct messages
- Prove knowledge of the secret key
- Use a modified scheme (such as [BLS Multi Sig](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/papers/BLSmultisig.html))

Fortunately, Filecoin can enforce the second condition to safely use the
aggregation property:
Filecoin uses aggregation only for aggregating the transaction's signature of a
block. Since Filecoin uses the account model to represent the state of the
chain, each message for a given signer is used in combination with a nonce to
avoid replay attacks. As a direct consequence, every transaction's message is
unique thereby the aggregation is done on distinct messages.  Obviously, the
**assumption** here is that the block producer **enforces that distinction** and
the other miners will **check all transactions** to make sure they are valid.
The validity of a transaction in Filecoin's context implies that the signature
is correctly formed over the message with the correct nonce.
