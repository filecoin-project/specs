# Signatures

## What are signatures in Filecoin

Signatures are cryptographic functions that attest to the origin of a particular message. In the context of Filecoin, signatures are used to send and receive messages among with the assurance that each message was generated by specific individuals. In other words, it is infeasible for another individual i to generate a signed message that appears to have been generated by j.

We use signatures in filecoin to verify *something* was done by *someone*. For example, we use signatures in order to validate deal messages which represent an action like a storage deals We also use signatures to determine who generated a particular message, determine public keys--which can be recovered from signed data and a signature, and find filecoin addresses which generated from a public key.

- Messages (From actors to the blockchain)
- Tickets (Signature of proof - [Mining](mining.md)
- Block signature (Signature over all data in the block - done by block leader)

# What signatures affect

What uses them

- Messages [TODO: Link to messages spec]
- Block validation
- Tickets which inform leader election in Expected Consensus (EC) [TODO: link to EC spec]

Note that messages between actors are not signed this is because messages between actors are always spawned by a message from a user -- which are singed by that user. 

Filecoin specific reliance

- SignedMessages in go-filecoin

# Dependencies

Things that affect our choices for signatures

- Elliptic curve choices - We use ECDSA with secp256k1 (aka the BitCoin elliptic curve)
- Signature size limits - Our signatures are 64 bytes + 1 byte for public key recovery
- Avg. processing power available to a CPU (signature aggregation)

Filecoin specific dependancies

- libsecp256k1

# Non-Dependencies

Does not affect

- Transport encryption
- File encodings (PoRep)

# Interface

Filecoin requires a system that fulfils the following interface to function correctly.

Note: `Message` is used here as the object being signed, but this interface should also work for other things that need to be signed. 

```go
type Signature interface {

	// Sign generates a proof that miner `M` generate message `m`
	//
	// Out:
	//    sig - a series of bytes representing a signature usually `r`|`s`
	//    err - a standard error message indicating any process issues
	// In:
	//    m - a series of bytes representing a message to be signed
	//    sk - a private key which cryptographically links `M` to `sig`
	//
	Sign(m Message, sk PrivateKey) (sig SignatureBytes, err error)

	// Verify validates the statement: only `M` could have generated `sig`
	// given the validator has a message `m`, a signature `sig`, and a
	// public key `pk`.
	//
	// Out:
	//    valid - a boolean value indicating the signature is valid
	//    err - a standard error message indicating any process issues
	// In:
	//    m - a series of bytes representing the signed message
	//    pk - the public key belonging to the signer `M`
	//    sig - a series of bytes representing a signature usually `r`|`s`
	//
	Verify(m Messgage, pk PublicKey, sig SignatureBytes) (valid bool, err error)

	// Recover, as its name implies, recovers a public key associated with a
	// particular signature. In the case of ECDSA signatures, this function can
	// be fulfilled via the 'ECRecover' method. If a different signature scheme
	// is used, then some other mechanism of 'recovering' a message authors
	// public key must be provided.
	//
	// Out:
	//    pk - the public key associated with `M` who signed `m`
	//    err - a standard error message indicating any process issues
	//    **
	// In:
	//    m - a series of bytes representing the signed message
	//    sig - a series of bytes representing a signature usually `r`|`s`
	//
	Recover(m Message, sig SignatureBytes) (pk PublicKey, err error)
}
```


# Selected Signature Scheme

Currently, Filecoin uses secp256k1 signatures to fulfill the above interface. All signatures on messages, blocks, and tickets currently use the same scheme and format.

## Wire Format

What bits are on the wire and in what order/format. We are currently adhering to libsecp256k1 serialization which is laid out as follows. Note that this format description may not be accurate. See the github link below for an authoritative format description.

**Signature**

```
sig SignatureBytes = [0x30][len][0x02][r][indicator][s][indicator][recovery]
```

`s` = Scalar of size 32 bytes

`r` = Compressed elliptic curve point (x-coordinate) of size 32 bytes

`recovery` = Information needed to recover a public key from `sig`. 

- LSB(0) = parity of y-coordinate of r
- LSB(1) = overflow indicator

`indicator` = a 2 byte formatting indicator

**Signed Message**

```
Type SignedMessage Struct {

    Message bytes `JSON`   

    Signature bytes `JSON` 
    
}
```

- Should elliptic curve points always be compressed in Marshal?

- Recover is math trick trading CPU for space to generate sk*G

- Serialization should account for :

- - Should there be point compression? 

  - Point compression (x,y); len(x) = n bits → x, recovery_bit; len(x||r_bit) = n+1 bits

  - - Easy to check add; use (mod2) or check last bit

  - Sig = (r,s) - s is standard but r could be (rx,ry) or rx or r all of these can be used to generate r*G

  - Recovery() can be used for (1) finding r*G from (r,s) and (2) pk = sk*G from SignatureBytes

  - Remember that y = sqrt(curve equation for x) and there are 2 valid solutions for y. This should be accounted for in sig if point compression is used (i.e. if a PublicKey is provided (no compression) or recovered (compression) OR r is a point (no compression) or scalar(compression))

Currently signatures are not sent over the wire on their own, instead they are encapsulated in in a [SignedMessage](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/blob/master/types/signed_message.go#L22-L28). SignesMessage’s contain a Message and a Signature. When we want to send a SignedMessage over the wire we marshal it to cbor and send, once it is recevied it is unmarshaled form [cbor](http://cbor.io/) back into the SignedMessage Structure.
