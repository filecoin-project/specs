# Filecoin State Machine Actors

Any implementations of the Filecoin actors must be exactly byte for byte compatible with the go-filecoin actor implementations. The pseudocode below tries to capture the important logic, but capturing all the detail would require embedding exactly the code from go-filecoin, so for now, its simply informative pseudocode. The algorithms below are correct, and all implementations much match it (including go-filecoin), but details omitted from here should be looked for in the go-filecoin code.

This spec describes a set of actors that operate within the [Filecoin State Machine](state-machine.md). All types are defined in [the basic type encoding spec](data-structures.md#basic-type-encodings).

- [Init Actor](#init-actor)
- [Storage Market Actor](#storage-market-actor)
- [Storage Miner Actor](#storage-miner-actor)
- [Payment Channel Broker Actor](#payment-channel-broker-actor)

## Built In Actors

Some state machine actors are 'system' actors that get instantiated in the genesis block, and have their IDs allocated at that point.

| ID   | Actor              | Name                    |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 0    | InitActor          | Network Init            |
| 1    | AccountActor       | Network Treasury        |
| 2    | StorageMarketActor | Filecoin Storage Market |
|  99 | AccountActor | Burnt Funds |

## Init Actor

The init actor is responsible for creating new actors on the filecoin network. This is a built-in actor and cannot be replicated. In the future, this actor will be responsible for loading new code into the system (for user programmable actors). ID allocation for user instantiated actors starts at 100. This means that `NextID` will initially be set to 100.

```go
type InitActor struct {
	// Mapping from Address to ID, for lookups.
	AddressMap map[Address]BigInt

	NextID BigInt
}
```

| -------- | ---------- |
| 1  | `Exec`     |
| 2 | `GetIdForAddress` |

### `Exec(code Cid, params []Param) Address`

>  This method is the core of the `Init Actor`. It handles instantiating new actors and assigning them their IDs.

### Parameters

| Name     | Type       | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `code`   | `Cid`      | A pointer to the location at which the code of the actor to create is stored. |
| `params` | `[] Param` | The parameters passed to the constructor of the actor.       |



`Param` is the type representing any valid arugment that can be passed to a function.

TODO: Find a better place for this definition.


```go
func Exec(code Cid, params []byte) Address {
	// Get the actor ID for this actor.
	actorID = self.NextID
	self.NextID++

	// Make sure that only the actors defined in the spec can be launched.
	if !IsBuiltinActor(code) {
		Fatal("cannot launch actor instance that is not a builtin actor")
	}

	// Ensure that singeltons can be only launched once.
	// TODO: do we want to enforce this? If so how should actors be marked as such?
	if IsSingletonActor(code) {
		Fatal("cannot launch another actor of this type")
	}

	// This generates a unique address for this actor that is stable across message
	// reordering
	addr := VM.ComputeActorAddress()

	// Set up the actor itself
	actor := Actor{
		Code:    code,
		Balance: msg.Value,
	}

	// The call to the actors constructor will set up the initial state
	// from the given parameters
	actor.Constructor(params)

	VM.GlobalState.Set(actorID, actor)

	// Store the mapping of address to actor ID.
	self.AddressMap[addr] = actorID

	return addr
}

func IsSingletonActor(code Cid) bool {
	return code == StorageMarketActor || code == InitActor
}

// TODO: find a better home for this logic
func (VM VM) ComputeActorAddress(creator Address, nonce Integer) Address {
	return NewActorAddress(bytes.Concat(creator.Bytes(), nonce.BigEndianBytes()))
}
```

### `GetIdForAddress(addr Address) BigInt`

> This method allows for fetching the corresponding ID of a given Address

### Parameters

| Name   | Type      | Description           |
| ------ | --------- | --------------------- |
| `addr` | `Address` | The address to lookup |



```go
func GetIdForAddress(addr Address) BigInt {
	id := self.AddressMap[addr]
	if id == nil {
		Fault("unknown address")
	}
	return id
}
```

## Account Actor

The Account actor is the actor used for normal keypair backed accounts on the filecoin network.

```go
type AccountActor struct {
	// Address contains the public key based address that this account was created with. If unset, this account may not send funds by normal means.
	Address Address
}
```

### Code Cid

`<codec:raw><mhType:identity><"account">`

| Index     | Method Name       |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1  | `GetAddress` |

## Storage Market Actor

The storage market actor is the central point for the Filecoin storage market. It is responsible for registering new miners to the system, and maintaining the power table. The Filecoin storage market is a singleton that lives at a specific well-known address.

```go
type StorageMarketActor struct {
	Miners AddressSet

	// TODO: Determine correct unit of measure. Could be denominated in the
	// smallest sector size supported by the network.
	TotalStorage BytesAmount
}
```

```go
func StorageMinerActor(worker Address, sectorSize BytesAmount, pid PeerID) {
	self.Owner = message.From
	self.Worker = worker
	self.PeerID = pid
	self.SectorSize = sectorSize
}

```go
func AddAsk(price TokenAmount, ttl Integer) AskID {
	if msg.From != self.Worker {
		Fatal("Asks may only be added via the worker address")
	}

	// Filter out expired asks
	self.Asks.FilterExpired()

	self.Asks.Append(Ask{
		Price:  price,
		Expiry: CurrentBlockHeight + ttl,
		ID:     askid,
	})

	return askid
}
```

Note: this may be moved off chain soon, don't worry about testing it too heavily.



### CommitSector

Parameters:

- sectorID SectorID
- commD []byte
- commR []byte
- commRStar []byte
- proof SealProof

Return: None


```go
// NotYetSpeced: ValidatePoRep, EnsureSectorIsUnique, CollateralForSector, Commitment
func CommitSector(sectorID SectorID, commD, commR, commRStar []byte, proof SealProof) SectorID {
	if !miner.ValidatePoRep(miner.SectorSize, comm, miner.Worker, proof) {
		Fatal("bad proof!")
	}

	// make sure the miner isnt trying to submit a pre-existing sector

	coll = CollateralForSector(miner.SectorSize)

	if coll < vm.MyBalance()-miner.ActiveCollateral {
		Fatal("not enough collateral")
	}

	miner.ActiveCollateral += coll

	// Note: There must exist a unique index in the miner's sector set for each
	// sector ID. The `faults`, `recovered`, and `done` parameters of the
	// SubmitPoSt method express indices into this sector set.
	miner.Sectors.Add(sectorID, commR, commD)

	// if miner is not mining, start their proving period now
	// Note: As written here, every miners first PoSt will only be over one sector.
	// We could set up a 'grace period' for starting mining that would allow miners
	// to submit several sectors for their first proving period. Alternatively, we
	// could simply make the 'CommitSector' call take multiple sectors at a time.
	//
	// Note: Proving period is a function of sector size; small sectors take less
	// time to prove than large sectors do. Sector size is selected when pledging.
	if miner.ProvingSet.Size() == 0 {
		miner.ProvingSet = miner.Sectors
		miner.ProvingPeriodEnd = chain.Now() + ProvingPeriodDuration(miner.SectorSize)
	}

	// burn funds for fees and collateral penalization
	BurnFunds(miner, CollateralForSectors(miner.SectorSize, permLostSet)+feesRequired)

	// update sector sets and proving set
	miner.Sectors.Subtract(done)
	miner.Sectors.Subtract(permLostSet)

	// update miner power to the amount of data actually proved during
	// the last proving period.
	oldPower := miner.Power

	miner.Power = (miner.ProvingSet.Count() - allFaults.Count()) * miner.SectorSize
	StorageMarket.UpdateStorage(miner.Power - oldPower)

	miner.ProvingSet = miner.Sectors

	// NEEDS REVIEW: early submission of PoSts may give the miner extra time for

}
```

### SlashStorageFault

Parameters:

- miner Address

Return: None

```go
func SlashStorageFault() {
	if self.SlashedAt > 0 {
		Fatal("miner already slashed")
	}

	if chain.Now() <= miner.ProvingPeriodEnd+GenerationAttackTime(miner.SectorSize) {
		Fatal("miner is not yet tardy")
	}

	if miner.ProvingSet.Size() == 0 {
		Fatal("miner is inactive")
	}

	// Strip miner of their power
	StorageMarketActor.UpdateStorage(-1 * self.Power)
	self.Power = 0

	// TODO: make this less hand wavey
	BurnCollateral(self.ConsensusCollateral)

	self.SlashedAt = CurrentBlockHeight
}
```

### GetCurrentProvingSet

Parameters: None

Return: `[][]byte`

```go
func GetCurrentProvingSet() [][]byte {
	return self.ProvingSet
}
```

Note: this is unlikely to ever be called on-chain, and will be a very large amount of data. We should reconsider the need for a list of all sector commitments (maybe fixing with accumulators?)

### ArbitrateDeal

This may be called by anyone to penalize a miner for dropping the data of a deal they committed to before the deal expires. Note: in order to call this, the caller must have the signed deal between the client and the miner in question, this would require out of band communication of this information from the client to acquire.

Parameters:

- deal Deal

Return: None

```go
func AbitrateDeal(d Deal) {
	if !ValidateSignature(d, self.Worker) {
		Fatal("invalid signature on deal")
	}

	if CurrentBlockHeight < d.StartTime {
		Fatal("Deal not yet started")
	}

	if d.Expiry < CurrentBlockHeight {
		Fatal("Deal is expired")
	}

	if !self.NextDoneSet.Has(d.PieceCommitment.Sector) {
		Fatal("Deal agreement not broken, or arbitration too late")
	}

	if self.ArbitratedDeals.Has(d.PieceRef) {
		Fatal("cannot slash miner twice for same deal")
	}

	pledge, storage := CollateralForDeal(d)

	// burn the pledge collateral
	self.BurnFunds(pledge)

	// pay the client the storage collateral
	TransferFunds(d.ClientAddr, storage)

	// make sure the miner can't be slashed twice for this deal
	self.ArbitratedDeals.Add(d.PieceRef)
}
```

TODO(scaling): This method, as currently designed, must be called once per sector. If a miner agrees to store 1TB (1000 sectors) for a particular client, and loses all that data, the client must then call this method 1000 times, which will be really expensive.

### DePledge

Parameters:

- amt TokenAmount

Return: None

```go
func DePledge(amt TokenAmount) {
	if msg.From != miner.Worker && msg.From != miner.Owner {
		Fatal("Not authorized to call DePledge")
	}

	if miner.DePledgeTime > 0 {
		if miner.DePledgeTime > CurrentBlockHeight {
			Fatal("too early to withdraw collateral")
		}

		TransferFunds(miner.Owner, miner.DePledgedCollateral)
		miner.DePledgeTime = 0
		miner.DePledgedCollateral = 0
		return
	}

	if amt > vm.MyBalance()-miner.ActiveCollateral {
		Fatal("Not enough free collateral to withdraw that much")
	}

	miner.DePledgedCollateral = amt
	miner.DePledgeTime = CurrentBlockHeight + DePledgeCooldown
}
```

### GetOwner

Parameters: None

Return: Address

```go
func GetOwner() Address {
	return self.Owner
}
```

### GetWorkerAddr

Parameters: None

Return: Address

```go
func GetWorkerAddr() Address {
	return self.Worker
}
```

### GetPower

Parameters: None

Return: BytesAmount

```go
func GetPower() BytesAmount {
	return self.Power
}
```

### GetPeerID

Parameters: None

Return: PeerID

```go
func GetPeerID() PeerID {
	return self.PeerID
}
```

### GetSectorSize

Parameters: None

Return: BytesAmount

```go
func GetSectorSize() BytesAmount {
	return self.SectorSize
}
```

### UpdatePeerID

Parameters:

- pid PeerID

Return: None

```go
func UpdatePeerID(pid PeerID) {
	if msg.From != self.Worker {
		Fatal("only the mine worker may update the peer ID")
	}

	self.PeerID = pid
}
```

### ChangeWorker

Changes the worker address. Note that since Sector Commitments take the miners worker key as an input, any sectors sealed with the old key but not yet submitted to the chain will be invalid. All future sectors must be sealed with the new worker key.

Parameters:
- addr Address

Return: None

```go
func ChangeWorker(addr Address) {
	if msg.From != self.Owner {
		Fatal("only the owner can change the worker address")
	}

	self.Worker = addr
}
```

## Payment Channel Broker Actor

TODO

## Multisig Account Actor

A basic multisig account actor. Allows sending of messages like a normal account actor, but with the requirement of M of N parties agreeing to the operation. Completed and/or cancelled operations stick around in the actors state until explicitly cleared out. Proposers may cancel transactions they propose, or transactions by proposers who are no longer approved signers.

Self modification methods (add/remove signer, change requirement) are called by
doing a multisig transaction invoking the desired method on the contract itself. This means the 'signature
threshold' logic only needs to be implemented once, in one place.

The [init actor](#init-actor) is used to create new instances of the multisig.

### State

```go
type Multisig struct {
	Signers  []Address
	Required uint

	NextTxID     uint64
	Transactions map[int]Transaction
}

type Transaction struct {
	Created   uint64
	TxID      uint64
	To        Address
	Value     TokenAmount
	Method    string
	Params    []byte
	Approved  []Address
	Completed bool
	Canceled  bool
}
```

### Propose

> Propose is used to propose a new transaction to be sent by this multisig. The proposer must be a signer, and the proposal also serves as implicit approval from the proposer. If only a single signature is required, then the transaction is executed immediately.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `to` |  `Address` | The address of the target of the proposed transaction. |
|  `value` | `TokenAmount` | The amount of funds to send with the proposed transaction |
|  `method` | `string` | The method that will be invoked on the proposed transactions target. |
| `params` | `[]byte` | The parameters that will be passed to the method invocation on the proposed transactions target. |

```go

### Approve

> Approve is called by a signer to approve a given transaction. If their approval pushes the approvals for this transaction over the threshold, the transaction is executed.

| Name     | Type       | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `txid` |  `uint64` | The ID of the transaction to approve. |


```go
func Approve(txid uint64) {
	if !self.isSigner(msg.From) {
		Fatal("not authorized")
	}

	tx := self.getTransaction(txid)
	if tx.Complete {
		Fatal("transaction already completed")
	}
	if tx.Canceled {
		Fatal("transaction canceled")
	}

	for _, signer := range tx.Approved {
		if signer == msg.From {
			Fatal("already signed this message")
		}
	}

	tx.Approved.Append(msg.From)

	if len(tx.Approved) >= self.Required {
		Send(tx.To, tx.Value, tx.Method, tx.Params)
		tx.Complete = true
	}
}
```

### Cancel

```go
func Cancel(txid uint64) {
	if !self.isSigner(msg.From) {
		Fatal("not authorized")
	}

	tx := self.getTransaction(txid)
	if tx.Complete {
		Fatal("cannot cancel completed transaction")
	}
	if tx.Canceled {
		Fatal("transaction already canceled")
	}

	proposer := tx.Approved[0]
	if proposer != msg.From && isSigner(proposer) {
		Fatal("cannot cancel another signers transaction")
	}

	tx.Canceled = true
}
```

### ClearCompleted

```go
func ClearCompleted() {
	if !self.isSigner(msg.From) {
		Fatal("not authorized")
	}

	for tx := range self.Transactions {
		if tx.Completed || tx.Canceled {
			self.Transactions.Remove(tx)
		}
	}
}
```

### AddSigner

```go
func AddSigner(signer Address) {
	if msg.From != self.Address {
		Fatal("add signer must be called by wallet itself")
	}
	if self.isSigner(signer) {
		Fatal("new address is already a signer")
	}

	self.Signers.Append(signer)
}
```

### RemoveSigner

```go
func RemoveSigner(signer Address) {
	if msg.From != self.Address {
		Fatal("remove signer must be called by wallet itself")
	}
	if !self.isSigner(signer) {
		Fatal("given address was not a signer")
	}

	self.Signers.Remove(signer)
}
```

### SwapSigner

```go
func SwapSigner(old, new Address) {
	if msg.From != self.Address {
		Fatal("swap signer must be called by wallet itself")
	}
	if !self.isSigner(old) {
		Fatal("given old address was not a signer")
	}
	if self.isSigner(new) {
		Fatal("given new address was already a signer")
	}

	self.Signers.Remove(old)
	self.Signers.Append(new)
}
```

### ChangeRequirement

```go
func ChangeRequirement(req int) {
	if msg.From != self.Address {
		Fatal("change requirement must be called by wallet itself")
	}
	if req < 1 {
		Fatal("requirement must be at least 1")
	}

	self.Required = req
}
```

### Helper Methods

The various helper methods called above are defined here.

```go
func isSigner(a Address) bool {
	for signer := range self.Signers {
		if a == signer {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}

func getTransaction(txid int) Transaction {
	tx, ok := self.Transactions[txid]
	if !ok {
		Fatal("no such transaction")
	}

	return tx
}
```
